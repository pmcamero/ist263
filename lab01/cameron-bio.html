        Hi! My name is Peyton Cameron, and I am an International Relations and Linguistics Studies double major.  I enjoy both of my majors so much due to their interdisciplinary natures.  For International Relations my concentrations are Europe and Intercultural Communications.  I enjoy learning about different culture and different countries histories as well as how those play out on the international stage.  For Linguistics Studies I enjoy learning about different components to language and how the interact and word together that I normally would have never known.  I also have a minor in Information Management and Technology, and I am very interested in learning more about different aspects of technology as well as important technological and management skills that will help me in the future.   

        In college I am a tour guide, a global ambassador, as well as on leadership for my sorority.  I spent my first semester of college in Strasbourg, France participating in Syracuse Universityâ€™s Discovery program.  Since I got to campus, I have gotten very involved in order to make our large campus seem smaller and more like home. 

        In my spare time I enjoy watching tv and movies, exercise, or hanging out with my friends and family.  I have an older brother and a twin sister so there was always something going on in our house growing up.  My family and I has moved around a lot, but I call San Diego, California my home.
