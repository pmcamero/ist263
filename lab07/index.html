            Hi! My name is <strong>Peyton Cameron</strong>, and I am an <strong>International Relations</strong> and <strong>Linguistics Studies </strong>double major.  
            I enjoy both of my majors so much due to their interdisciplinary natures.  
            <br>For International Relations my concentrations are Europe and Intercultural Communications.  
            I enjoy learning about different cultures and different countries’ histories as well as how those play out on the international stage.  
            <br>For Linguistics Studies I enjoy learning about different components to language and how they interact and work together that I normally would have never known.  
            <br>I also have a minor in <strong>Information Management and Technology</strong>, and I am very interested in learning more about different aspects of technology as well as important technological and management skills that will help me in the future.   
        </p>
        <p>
            In college I am a tour guide, a global ambassador, as well as on leadership for my sorority.  
            <br>I spent my first semester of college in Strasbourg, France participating in Syracuse University’s Discovery program.  
            Since I got to campus, I have gotten very involved in order to make our large campus seem smaller and more like home. 
        </p>

        <h2>Personal Information</h2>
       
            In my spare time I enjoy:
                <ul>
                <li>watching tv and movies</li>
                <li>exercise</li>
                <li>learning languages</li>
                <li>hanging out with friends and family</li>
                </ul>  
        <p>
                I have an older brother and a twin sister so there was always something going on in our house growing up.  
            My family and I have moved around a lot, but I call San Diego, California my home.
