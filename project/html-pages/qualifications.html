                At Syracuse University, I am an International Relations and Linguistics Studies double major with a minor in Information Management and Technology. I have spent a good portion of my undergraduate career studying linguistics and taking linguistics courses. As a junior at Syracuse, I have almost finished my linguistics major and I have written a research paper for essentially every linguistics course that I have taken.
